# Calculator-Aura

Trying to replicate the simple calculator on Mac

Changes TBD
1. preceeding 0's need to be removed, else operation fails due to strict mode
2. Once the result is shown, the user can change the number. Don't allow this.
3. There are absolutely no comments, have to add them.
4. Clear All button to clear everything in the calculation scope.
5. Allow decimal to be added to the input numbers. Currently it is stripped out by regex.
